ResBaz Sydney 2020 will be held at The University of Sydney. Register your interest in participating below.

Each year ResBaz Sydney is a little different, but you can get a sense of what ResBaz was like [last year](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2019/sydney/) by looking over the [full program](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2019/sydney/Resbaz2019_Program.pdf) and you can even see some [photos and video recordings](https://research.unsw.edu.au/resbaz-sydney) of some of the presentations.
